* Total 4 APIs are implemented in the application(/storeurl,/get,/count,/list).
* User will first hit the /storeurl API in order to register the URL. Any other API hit without the url registration will not give the desired response
* Now once the URL is registered. If the /get API is hit and the parameter URL is present in the database(local variable in our case) then it will return the Unique short key generated by the system. 
* The /count API returns the number of usage counts by the user and takes URL as parameter.
* The /list API returns the list of URLs and its count with pagination. The page parameter determines the page and size parameter determines the number of objects from that page.
* HashMap is used instead of database to store the data. 
* Unit testing is implemented to test all 4 APIs simultaneously.
